🚀 Getting Started

Step 1: Fork the Repository

Navigate to [Symboisis Repository](https://github.com/charmi2208/Symboisis)
Click the Fork button in the top-right corner.
This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/FMEA_SupplyChain.git
cd FMEA_SupplyChain

Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username.

Step 3: Add Upstream Remote

Add the original repository as an upstream remote to keep your fork synced:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/gdg-charusat/FMEA_SupplyChain.git

Verify the remotes:

git remote -v

You should see:
origin   — your fork [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Zaplink_frontend.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/FMEA_SupplyChain.git)
upstream — the original [https://github.com/gdg-charusat/FMEA_SupplyChain.git](https://github.com/gdg-charusat/FMEA_SupplyChain.git)

Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment

Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

Linux/Mac:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Step 5: Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 6: Download Required NLTK Data

python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')"

Step 7: Set Up Environment File

Copy the example environment file and fill in your settings:

Windows:  copy .env.example .env
Linux/Mac: cp .env.example .env

Most fields in .env are optional. The system works without any API keys 
using rule-based mode.

Step 8: Run the App to Verify Setup

streamlit run app.py

Navigate to http://localhost:8501 in your browser. If the dashboard loads, 
your setup is complete.

Alternatively, test with the CLI:

python cli.py --structured FMEA.csv --output output/test.xlsx --no-model

Step 9: Create a New Branch

IMPORTANT: Always create a new branch for your work. Never work directly 
on the main branch.

git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

Branch Naming Convention:
feature/  — for new features       (e.g., feature/voice-input)
fix/      — for bug fixes           (e.g., fix/rpn-calculation-error)
docs/     — for documentation       (e.g., docs/update-setup-guide)
style/    — for styling changes     (e.g., style/dashboard-theme)
refactor/ — for code refactoring    (e.g., refactor/preprocessing-module)
test/     — for adding tests        (e.g., test/risk-scoring-unit-tests)

💻 Development Workflow

1. Pick an Issue

Browse the Issues page at https://github.com/charmi2208/Symboisis/issues
Look for issues labelled:
  - good first issue or level: beginner — for beginners
  - level: intermediate — for intermediate contributors
  - level: advanced — for advanced contributors

Comment on the issue with your request and team number, e.g.:
"Hi, I'd like to work on this issue. - Team 07"

Wait to be officially assigned — do not start writing any code until 
a maintainer assigns you.
Do not work on an issue already assigned to someone else.

2. Understand the Project Structure

Understand which module your issue touches:

src/preprocessing.py    — text cleaning, sentiment analysis
src/llm_extractor.py    — LLM-based field extraction
src/risk_scoring.py     — Severity, Occurrence, Detection, RPN calculation
src/fmea_generator.py   — main orchestration class
src/utils.py            — shared helper functions
app.py                  — Streamlit dashboard
cli.py                  — command line interface
mitigation_module/      — mitigation plan generation
config/config.yaml      — all configurable parameters

3. Make Your Changes

Write clean, readable Python code.
Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
Add docstrings to any new function you create.
Do not change unrelated files — keep your PR focused on one issue only.
Test your changes by running the app and CLI before submitting.

4. Test Your Changes

Run the dashboard:
streamlit run app.py

Run the CLI with sample data:
python cli.py --structured FMEA.csv --output output/test.xlsx --no-model

Run the examples:
python examples.py

Run pytest if your issue involves src/ modules:
python -m pytest tests/ -v

If your issue adds new logic, add at least one test in the tests/ folder.

5. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: add voice input processor to app.py"

Commit Message Format:
feat:     — new feature
fix:      — bug fix
docs:     — documentation changes
style:    — formatting or CSS changes
refactor: — code restructuring without behaviour change
test:     — adding or updating tests
chore:    — maintenance tasks like updating requirements.txt

6. Push to Your Fork

git push origin feature/your-feature-name

7. Create a Pull Request

Go to your fork on GitHub.
Click "Compare & pull request".
Fill out the PR completely:
  - Title: clear and descriptive (e.g., "Add OCR document upload to dashboard")
  - Team Number: you must state your team number — PRs without this will be closed
  - Issue Reference: link the assigned issue (e.g., Closes #12)
  - Description: explain what you changed and why
  - Screenshots: required if your change affects the Streamlit dashboard UI
Click "Create pull request".

How to Request an Issue

Find an unassigned issue you want to work on.
Comment on the issue with this format:
"I'd like to work on this. - Team [your team number]"

Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you — this is mandatory.
Once assigned, start working and submit your PR within 3–5 days.
If you can't complete it in time, comment to let maintainers know.

⚠️ Before opening a new issue, ensure:
- The issue does not already exist
- It is clearly documented
- It aligns with the project scope (FMEA generation, supply chain risk, 
  NLP, dashboard, CLI)

---

Creating a New Issue

When creating a new issue:
- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Add a detailed description covering:
  What is the problem or feature?
  Which file or module does it affect?
  Steps to reproduce (if a bug)
  Expected vs actual behaviour
  Screenshots (if UI-related)
- Wait for maintainer review before starting work

---

🔄 Pull Request Process

PR Requirements — Non-Negotiable

PRs that don't meet ALL of the following will be closed without review:

☐ Team number stated in the PR description (e.g., Team XX)
☐ Linked to your assigned issue via Closes #issue-number
☐ You are the assigned contributor for that issue
☐ PR is raised after assignment, not before

Before Submitting

☐ streamlit run app.py runs without errors
☐ python cli.py --structured FMEA.csv --output output/test.xlsx --no-model works
☐ python -m pytest tests/ passes (or you have documented why a test was skipped)
☐ No new print() statements added to src/ modules — use logging instead
☐ No secrets, API keys, or .env files committed
☐ Commit messages follow the conventional format above
☐ If dashboard UI was changed, before/after screenshots are in the PR

PR Review Process

A maintainer will review your PR within 24–48 hours.
You may be asked to make changes — respond promptly.
Make requested changes and push to the same branch (PR auto-updates).
Only maintainers can approve and merge — do not request peers to merge.

Addressing Review Comments

Make the requested changes, then:

git add .
git commit -m "fix: address review comments on voice input validation"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

🎯 Tips for Success

Start Small: Begin with a beginner issue to understand how the pipeline works 
before touching src/ modules.

Run Everything First: Before changing anything, run streamlit run app.py and 
python examples.py to see what the project actually does. You will understand 
the code far better after seeing it in action.

Read the Guides: This repo has detailed documentation for every major feature. 
START_HERE.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, and YOUR_DATA_GUIDE.md will save you hours.

Use --no-model: If you don't have a powerful machine, add --no-model to all 
CLI commands. The rule-based mode is fast and works for most issues without 
needing a GPU or large model download.

Ask Questions: It is better to ask than to waste time going in the wrong 
direction. Comment on your assigned issue and maintainers will help.

Be Patient: Code review takes time — be responsive to feedback when it comes.

Have Fun: This is about learning NLP, LLMs, supply chain analysis, and 
open source collaboration all at once. Enjoy it!
